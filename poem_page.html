						<u>Meet Me In Forever</u>
			
				It's like our souls entwined the first day we met
				Heard whispers on the wind
				You're someone worth the bet
				Sparkle of tommorrow showed the love I've to get
				Symphonies in your voice is something i'd forever lean on
				
				Like moonlight serenade, your words flatter my ears
				In my euphoria, i didnt hold back my tears
				We have let the eyes talk, fading away my fears
				Dear, you are my end game, my love 'till my last years
				We are twin flames who met to make our lives better
				
				I am you, you are me, We're perfect together
				We'll spend our lives happy and free, come whatever
				So love, meet me in forever

						<u>Love of my life</u>
			
				I was a person who hated the idea of ♡ love ♡
				Until... you came along
				You brought a new page of hope in the mundane journal of mine
				like every heart has, its own loving paradise
				Mine..became you
				We both did not believe in fake forevers
				but rather made each moment
				last like an eternity
				Every promise you made was blissful entity
